Bamazon App:

1. All of the items available for sale are displayed in a table in the terminal. Including the ids, names, and prices of products for sale. 

2. The app prompts users with two messages.

3. The first will ask the ID of the product they would like to buy and the second message will ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

4. Once the customer has placed the order, the app will check if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

5. If not, the app will log "Insufficient quantity. We cannot process your order.", and then prevent the order from going through.

6. However, if the store does have enough of the product, the app will fulfill the customer's order.

7. The SQL database will be updated to reflect the remaining quantity. 

8. Once the update goes through, the customer will be shown the total cost of their purchase.
